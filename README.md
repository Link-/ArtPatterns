Islamic Art Patterns 
=====================

This project is a naive attempt at replicating some Art Patterns from the Islamic epoch and animating them in interesting ways.

Basically this project is written for Processing, however it's **100% portable** to processing.js (http://processingjs.org) and an implementation of it can be found on my website
(http://bassemdy.com)

No setup is needed. Just run the code in processing and you'll be good to go.

Btw, TriangloPod: I have no idea why I came up with that name or from where...

Usage
-----

    'p': Increase the number of points used in the TriangloPod
    'l': Decrease the number of points used in the TriangloPod
    'o': Increase the outer radius
    'k': Decrease the outer radius
    'i': Increase the inner radius
    'j': Decrease the inner radius
