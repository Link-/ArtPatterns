Islamic Art Patterns 
=====================

This project is a naive attempt at replicating some Art Patterns from the Islamic epoch and animating them in interesting ways.

Basically this project is written for Processing, however it's 100% portable to processing.js and an implementation of it can be found on my website
(http://bassemdy.com)

No setup is needed. Just run the code in processing and you'll be good to go.
